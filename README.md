# Shakespeare
1. Data Ingestion
Shakespeare Corpus: The raw dataset containing Shakespeareâ€™s plays, often in CSV format.

CSV Preprocessing: This step involves cleaning the data, removing irrelevant information such as stage directions, and organizing the dialogue into a usable format for embedding and training.

2. Fine-tuning
Pre-trained Model (Mistral7B): A powerful pre-trained language model (Mistral7B), which is a large language model capable of understanding general text. It is used as the base model for this system.

Training Dataset: A dataset containing Shakespeare's works, which is used to fine-tune the pre-trained model. This step adapts the model to answer questions specifically about Shakespeare's plays.

Fine-tuned Model: The fine-tuned model is a more specialized version of the original pre-trained model, optimized to handle questions and answers about Shakespeare's texts.

3. Model Quantization
Quantization to 4-bit: During the quantization process, the fine-tuned model is compressed to use 4-bit precision rather than the original 32-bit floating-point precision. This reduces the memory and storage requirements of the model, allowing it to run on lower-end hardware while maintaining good performance.

Reduced Memory Usage: By using 4-bit quantization, the model's memory footprint is significantly reduced, allowing it to run more efficiently on GPUs with lower memory, such as those available in cloud services or smaller-scale environments. This also decreases the model's storage space, making it easier to deploy at scale.

4. Retrieval Augmentation
FAISS Index: The FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) index is a high-performance vector database used to store and retrieve embeddings of Shakespeare's dialogue. These embeddings are generated from the text using the fine-tuned model.

Query Embedding: When a user asks a question, the question is converted into an embedding (numerical vector) that represents its semantic meaning. This allows for efficient searching in the FAISS index.

Reranking (Cross-Encoder): After retrieving a set of potential answers from FAISS, a Cross-Encoder model is used to rerank the candidates based on their relevance to the query. This step refines the initial retrieval to ensure that the top results are the most contextually accurate.

5. Inference API
Inference API (Gradio): The Gradio interface exposes the model's functionality as a web service that can accept user queries, process them, and return answers. This API handles all the logic, including passing the query through the FAISS search and generating the response.

Question Input: The user enters a question via a textbox in the UI, which is then passed to the Inference API.

Answer Output: The Inference API generates an answer based on the retrieved context and the model's understanding, which is displayed to the user.

6. User Interface
Gradio UI: The Gradio UI provides a simple, interactive front-end where users can type in their questions and receive answers. The interface interacts with the Inference API, making the system easy to use without needing to understand the underlying architecture.
